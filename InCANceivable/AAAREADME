This is the top level set of examples .... 

frc_snoop should configure a canBeds seed to snoop on FRC canbus messages and
dump the resulting messages on the serial port output. No guarantees that every message will be parsed if the serial bus is too busy.

write_test configures a canBed to write stuff on the CanBus.  Useful for the following:  given two CANBeds put frc_snoop on one and write_test on the other then hook them together -- zeroth order test!

InCANCeivable_lib_test is a sample top level Arduino sketch.  
  This is a sketch to copy and modify with your particular sensor package.

CANceive_analogUSRange is a fully functional example. 
   It's nastier in that it sets up the CAN bus so it only listens to ID's that we are interested in.  This functionality could be built into the libraries/InCANceivable.    And it reads out the really dumb $4 ultrasonic range finder HC-SR04 (sparkfun product number)    The range finder is dumb so it takes a lot of code in this sketch to make it run. 

CANceive_analogUSRange_accel extends the CANceive_analogUSRange sketch by also reading out a MMA8452Q I2c mounted accclerometer. 

Presumably other CANceive'd things would be built -- this is where you would 
put specific top level sketches for your robot!
