This is the libraries directory where the Arduino IDE looks for functions that can be compiled in.  
A brief summary of stuff in the the libraries file tree:

* CANBed/ has the code from SeeedStudio that sets up the CAN bus chips and 
provides the interfaces to get/set the configuration as well as read, write
data;  It is unlikely that someone using the InCANceivable rig will need to
root around in this directory.

* InCANceivable/ has the code to make it easier to use the CANBed on the CAN 
bus inside an FRC robot. 
  InCANceivable.h declares functions that are your entry point! It calls functions declared in other .h files in this directory and defined in .cpp files 
   It should be enough to include this header file in your top level Arduino sketch to get the functionality you need to speak FRC CAN. 

* InCAN_interfaces contains the glue layers for individual sensors 
  Users who want to set up a new sensor or change how a sensor is read out 
  work here. 
  For example say you have an MMA8452Q accelerometer with the library for it from SparkFun (or somewhere else)  this is where you would put code to read it out and massage any data. 
The design pattern intended is to create an InCAN_<device>.h and .cpp pair of files, each one contains  a device_init() function that does any sensor setup,  it has a device_config() that provids the location of memory that will be used to send output messages,  device_update() reads sensor values and maybe stores it for future use (say you wanted to do an average of 10 sensor readings to reduce noise, update will read and add to the list of data to be averaged). Finally device_emit() puts data on the CANbus.  
* Other directories probably have code from sensor vendors.
